# Project Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been improving significantly in both performance and efficiency. Versatile architectures such as ResNet [1] and DenseNet [2] have made creating an “intelligent” object classification NN as straightforward as ever. In this paper, we apply these prominent architectures in order to recognize the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet, as well as 3 other signs. Various techniques are utilized to generalize, expand, normalize, and, overall, improve our model’s test accuracy. In the end we test our network on webcam pictures to simulate the model’s ability to detect ASL letters in real time. The results show that a rich, robust dataset is necessary for a neural network to learn the nuances of how to distinguish sign letters from each other. Data which is not varied in its presentation of sign letters (background, position, etc.) will train a network with a narrow understanding of the ASL alphabet. Thus, resulting in low test accuracy.
